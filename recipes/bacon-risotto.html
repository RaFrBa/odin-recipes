    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 pound bacon, diced</li>
      <li>5 cups chicken stock</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1/2 onions, diced</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook and stir the diced bacon in a large
        skillet over medium heat until browned, about
        10 minutes. Drain the bacon and reserve.
      </li>
      <li><p>Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a 
        saucepan over high heat; reduce heat to low to
        keep the chicken stock hot.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large, heavy-
        bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the
        onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion
        begins to turn golden brown at the edges, about
        2 minutes. <p>Pour in the rice and stir until the
        rice is coated in butter and has started to toast,
        2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium.; Stir in
        one-third of the hot chicken stock and continue
        stirring until the rice has absorbed the liquid and
        turned creamy.</p> Repeat this process twice more, 
        stirring constantly. Stirring in the broth should
        take 15 to 20 minutes in all. When finished, the
        rice should be tender, yet slightly firm.
        </li>
        <li><p>Remove the risotto from the heat and stir
          in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, the
          Parmesan cheese, and the reserved bacon. Season
          to taste with salt and pepper before serving.</p>
