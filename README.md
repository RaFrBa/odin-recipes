# odin-recipes
First HTML Odin Project

Description:
In this beginner-level project I'm going to build a website containing various recipes using HTML (the website; not the recipes). 

By completing it I'll demonstrate a firm grasp of the skills I've been learning from Odin so far - correct use of elements and attributes, basic file structuring, etc.
